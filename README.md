## Fredkin's Paradox

The Fredkin's Paradox is the notion that, when two choices are very similar, the decision-maker will spend a lot more time and resources making that decision than a decision with significantly different expected outcomes, even though the value gained by such calculations is much thinner than the one with a significant difference in expected outcomes.  
One such decision, as we probably have all experienced in the past, is the decision (or rather indecision) of "where the fuck do I want to eat." SporkList seeks to solve that problem in the most efficient manner: coinflips.

## What is SporkList?
SporkList is a playlist for food; a "food player", if you will. It allows you to create playlists of restaurants, dynamically selects an option based on user-set preferences, and lets you share your SporkLists with your friends. Built on cutting-edge technology, SporkList is lightweight and flexible, running on almost every web-enabled platform. We use Angular.js, Parse, Google Analytics, Big Data, Cloud Computing, Parallelism, and Moore's Law together to create the ultimate and seemless connection between social media and social outings.
