## Fredkin's Paradox

The Fredkin's Paradox is the notion that, when two choices are very similar, the decision-maker will spend a lot more time and resources making that decision than a decision with significantly different expected outcomes, even though the value gained by such calculations is much thinner than the one with a significant difference in expected outcomes.  
One such decision, as we probably have all experienced in the past, is the decision (or rather indecision) of "where the fuck do I want to eat." sporklist seeks to solve that problem in the most efficient manner: coinflips.

## What is sporklist?
sporklist is a playlist for food; a "food player", if you will. What it does is it allows you to create playlists of restaurants, quickly gives you a choice when you select a playlist, and lets you share your sporklists with your friends. Built on cutting-edge technology, sporklist is lightweight and flexible, running on almost every web-enabled platform. We use Angular.js, Parse, Google Analytics, big data, cloud computing, parallelism, and Moore's Law together to create the ultimate and seemless connection between social media and social outings.
